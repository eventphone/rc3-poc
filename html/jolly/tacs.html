<p>
Total Access Communication System (TACS) and ETACS are mostly-obsolete variants of Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) which was announced as the choice for the first two UK national cellular systems in Feb 1983.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Frequency range base station: 935.0125 MHz - 949.9875 MHz
	<li>Frequency range mobile station: 890.0125 MHz - 904.9875 MHz
	<li>Control channels: 21 for System A
	<li>Voice channels: 289 for System A
	<li>Control channels: 21 for System B
	<li>Voice channels: 289 for System B
	<li>Duplex distance: 45 MHz
	<li>Channel spacing: 25 KHz
	<li>Voice modulation: FM
	<li>Signaling modulation: carrier FSK
	<li>Frequency deviation: 6.4 KHz (FSK)
	<li>Mobile station transmit power: 10 or 4 Watts (vehicular) 1.6 or 0.63 Watts
	<li>Base station transmit power: ??? (around 50 Watts)
</ul>

<p>
(J)TACS is the UK and Japanese version of the AMPS.
There are three major differences:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Different channel frequencies
	<li>6,400 Hz signaling rate (instead of 8,000 Hz)
	<li>Encoding of mobile station number
</ul>

<p>
Refer to <a href="amps.html">AMPS</a> documentation, but use executable 'tacs' or 'jtacs' instead of 'amps'.
