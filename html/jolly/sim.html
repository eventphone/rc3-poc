<h2><center>C-Netz SIM Emulator</center></h2>

<center><img src="sim.jpg"/></center>

<p>
Why emulating a SIM card?
Maybe you got an a C-Netz phone from the attic, friend or Ebay?
But the SIM card is missing. Without SIM card you cannot use your C-Netz phone at all.
Then you buy a high price on Ebay to get a used SIM card.
You find out that the SIM card requires a PIN that you don't know.
Even if you find a SIM card with no PIN enabled, it may not work with newer phones.
The emulator can help you in this case. 
</p>

<p>
Also the emulator can be used to emulate service cards or special cards that enable cell monitoring.
With this emulator you can modify all subscriber data without restrictions.

Emulating SIM Card
</p>

<center><img src="sim-rs232.jpg"/></center>

<p>
The easiest way to emulate a C-Netz SIM card is to use your Linux PC with a serial interface connected to the card reader of the phone.
Connection can be made directly via wires or via ISO card PCB.
You may also use an old ISO card an drill away the chip inside. Then solder thin wires close to the pads and connect them to a serial interface.
</p>

<p>
In order to connect the card to your Linux PC, you need a serial-to-USB interface.
Don't use the 9 pin SUB-D type of interface, because they have level shifters and will brick your phone.
Use TTL level interface as shown in the image above.
</p>

<p>
Because the SIM cards uses TTL level, we can connect a CP2102 controller directly to the card reader of a phone.
Don't worry about 5 Volts level from the card reader. The CP2102 can handle it.
In order to connect TX and RX together on one pad of the SIM card, we need to add a diode between the I/O pad and the TX output.
The cathode must point towards the TX output, so that TX can only pull the I/O line low (0).
Use a diode with a low forward voltage drop, like a Schottky diode. I use a simple 1n4148 Silicon diode and it works too.
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Important: Some serial interfaces have wrong signal labels.
TX and RX might be reversed, so that TX is actually an input and RX an output.
You will find out when you connect an Milliamp meter between signal and ground.
The output will have several Milliamps, but the input doesn't.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Important: Be sure to run your phone on battery and not via gounded power supply.
If the output of the power supply is grounded, the ground of your power line is also connected to the phone's card reader.
Voltage spikes on the power line's ground between your PC and your phone may kill the card reader or the USB port.
Use an isolating transformer!
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Important: The serial interface must support 8e2. (8 data bits, even parity, two stop bits)
I suggest to use the CP2102. If you know other serial interfaces that work, let me know.
</font>
</p>

</pre>

<p>
When the phone is switched on, the SIM card is powered up and outputs the ATR sequence (Answer To Reset).
</p>

<p>
The first message is a command message that is transmitted from the phone towards the SIM card.
The layer 2 header indicates the direction and the length of 15 bytes.
The ICR layer has no meaning with the C-Netz.
Except for the MASTER/SLAVE-BIT, no other bit is used.
The layer 7 (application) header indicates the command and the message type and length, followed by 11 bytes of data.
This command tells the SIM card to select C-Netz application.
</p>

<p>
The second message is a response message that is transmitted from the SIM card towards the phone.
The layer 2 header indicates the direction and the length of 4 bytes.
The layer 7 header indicates the response and status bits and length, followed by 0 bytes of data.
The response tells the SIM card that a PIN is required to complete the command.
The user is prompted to enter the pin.
</p>

Build Your Own SIM Card
</p>

<center><img src="sim_layout.png"/></center>

<p>
You find the PCB drawings inside the "layout" directory of the git repository.
Be sure to print it without scaling!
Check if the printed size matches an ISO card.
Also there is the source files for the 'Eagle' layout program, if you like to change it.
</p>

<p>
You may use an "Arduino UNO" or "ATTINY85" to emulate a SIM card without a PC.
In case of the Arduino, you still need wires to connect it to the card reader of the phone.
If you use an ATTINY85, you can put the micro controller directly on a PCB card, as shown on top of this page.
</p>

<p>
To compile and run with Arduino, you need to open "src/sim/sim.ino" with Arduino software and select the "Arduino UNO" board.
The RESET input is at pin 6 and the I/O line at pin 7.
Connect these two lines together with ground line to the card reader or ISO card PCB.
You don't need a diode this time, since pin 7 is automatically switched between input and output.
The serial protocol is emulated in software.
The status LED (pin 13) will flash whenever a message is received from the card reader.
</p>

<p>
To compile and run with ATTINY85, you need to open "src/sim/sim.ino" with Arduino software and select the "ATiny25/45/85" board and the "ATiny85" chip.
Refer to the internet on how to compile and flash the ATTINY85 without boot-loader.
It is beyond the scope of this documentation.
This time you need 5 wires to connect (VCC and Clock also).
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Important: After flashing you need to wait 10 seconds before removing power.
During that time the EEPROM is initialized.
If you would read out the EEPROM, you will notice the letter 'C' at address 0.
Then you would know that the init process was finished with success.
</font>
</p>

<p>
If you use the DIP version of the ATTINY85, you cannot put it on the card itself.
The PCB in the picture on top of this page shows the DIP socket next to the actual card area.
Be sure to put the chip on the back side of the SIM card.
This works only if the phone does not completely enclose the card.
</p>

<p>
If you use the SOIC version of the ATTINY85, you need to make it flat, so it fits into your phone.
You may use the full size SIM or just the mini SIM.
I prefer the mini SIM and use an adapter card for larger phones.
</p>

<center><img src="sim-attiny85.jpg"/></center>

<p>
The original ATTINY85 (1) is shown upside down.
Bend the legs straight and shorten them, so they still fit into a programmer's socket. (2)
Use P400 sand paper to sand off the bottom of the chip's case, until you reach the copper plate. (3)
Make a hole into the PBC and solder the chip upside down into that hole.
Pin 1 is marked on the PCB.
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Important: You need to change clock source to pin 1.
</font>
</p>

<p>
Change lower fuse of 0xc0.
Note that you will not be able to do any further programming unless you apply clock signal to pin 1.
Use a crystal oscillator connected to pin 1 when you like to update the firmware in the future.
You may also use other type of clock signal.
Try something between 1 and 8 MHz.
I recommend to use the USBasp or a clone of that. It is cheap and easy and works with USB.
To set the fuses using "avrdude" in conjunction with "usbasp" flash tool, use:<br>
<br>
avrdude -c usbasp-clone -p t85 -U lfuse:w:0xc0:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U efuse:w:0xff:m<br>
<br>
If you run it again, you might notice that there is no response without a clock applied.
Apply a clock to pin 1 and see if you get a response again.
</p>

<a name="usage"></a>
Using the SIM Card
</p>

<p>
After powering up the phone with SIM adapter/emulator attached, the phone should show the default subscriber number (FUTLN) on the display.
(Not all phones do. Read the manual to get the key code on how to show the subscriber number.)
There is no PIN enabled by default, so the SIM card is ready after inserting or poweing up the phone.
Now you can make calls, add telephone numbers or change PIN.
</p>

<p>
The SIM card can emulate 8 different cards.
They share the same telephone directory, but have different subscriber data.
Subscriber data can be changed to anything you like.
This way it is possible to even emulate service cards ("Wartungskarten"), to put phones into service mode or special cell monitor mode.
</p>

<p>
If the PIN is disabled (default), the first card with first subscriber data is emulates.
To select different card with dfferent subscriber data, change the PIN to 0001 .. 0008.
Refer to the phone's manual on how to change the PIN.
E.g. if you store the PIN 0000 or 0001, the first card with the first subscriber data is emulated.
E.g. if you store the PIN 0005, the fifth card with the fifth subscriber data is emulated.
In all cases, there is no PIN required when you turn on the phone.
</p>

</table>
</p>

<p>
You may want to use a PIN to select the card whenever you turn on the phone.
Use the phone to enable a PIN that does not start with "000".
When you restart your phone, you may enter that PIN, to select the first card.
Alternatively you may enter the PIN 0000 or 0001, to select the first card, no matter what the PIN was.
Or you may enter the PIN 0002 .. 0008, to select second to eighth card.
</p>

<p>
You may also alter each of the 8 different subscriber data store on the SIM.
In order to do that, you need to set a PIN, so the phone will ask for a PIN whenever it is turned on.
Choose any PIN you like, but not a PIN stat starts with 000.
Turn on the phone and you will be asked for a PIN.
Enter the PIN 9991 to alter the first subscriber data.
Enter the PIN 9992 .. 9998 to alter second to eighth subscriber data.
The subscriber data is shown in the telephone directory and can be altered by changing the numbers in that directory.
